# Linux from scratch site spider
This project originated from a hobby of a good friend of downloading various websites to the local area. It happened to be practicing python recently, so I promised him to try to crawl down <a href='http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/' target='_blank'>Linux from scratch</a> entire site. 

First of all, this is convenient for viewing in a disconnected environment. Secondly, it is also a hobby of collecting. When he told me this idea, I also found it very interesting. And he still has to say, "It would be better if I could support the resuming and updating of the breakpoint." Well, I promise you!

Special statement, this project is not used for any commercial purpose, purely for fun, if you violate any of your rights, please contact me. (cengzhaochuang@stu.csust.edu.cn)
